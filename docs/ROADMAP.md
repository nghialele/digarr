# Roadmap

> Updated: 2026-04-12 | Current: v0.24.2
>
> Priorities change with feedback. This is current intent, not a promise.

## Where We Are

All five v1 exit criteria now pass. Digarr is feature-complete for a v1 release, and the first full library-sync stack is now shipped across Lidarr, Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby. Multilingual support is fully shipped: all UI strings are translated across 15 locales, and AI-assisted discovery output follows the user's selected language. Deezer OAuth connect with four authenticated data sources (favorites, followed, Flow, playlists) shipped in v0.22.0. Discovery mode expansion is nearly complete: the currently runnable modes are ListenBrainz (Artist Radio, User Radio, Tag Radio, Similar Users Quick/Deep), Release Radar, and Similar Artist Web. Labels and Artist Relationships remain planned and are marked unavailable in the UI until they have real integrations. Current focus is download-target breadth and the remaining two discovery modes.

## v1 Goals

### New User Can Reach First Value -- Pass

Setup wizard, Spotify playlist import, CSV import, and guided empty states get new users to their first recommendations without friction.

### Core Discovery Is Resilient -- Pass

External source failures degrade gracefully. Image and metadata fallbacks cover the major fragile paths. The app gives useful results even when Spotify is unavailable.

### Operators Have Safety Rails -- Pass

Backup/restore, pre-flight migration checks, auto-backup before upgrades, and data hygiene repair tools are all in place.

### Background Work Is Observable -- Pass

Admin job tracking surface with health endpoint, run history, stuck-task detection, and actionable error messages.

### Critical Workflows Have Release Protection -- Pass

End-to-end browser test suite (Playwright) covering setup, login, scan, approve/reject, discovery modes, subscriptions, and playlists. CI gates on critical workflow failures.

## Planned

Committed direction, roughly in priority order.

### Discovery

- ~~Deezer favorites import~~ shipped in v0.22.0 (OAuth connect + favorites, followed, Flow, playlists)
- ~~Deeper ListenBrainz integration (radio, similar-users coverage)~~ shipped in v0.23.0; ~~tag radio~~ shipped in v0.24.0 (with recording-artist cache for MB resolution)
- Label-catalog discovery mode implementation
- Artist-relationship discovery mode implementation

### Integrations

- slskd / Soulseek as a download target

### UX

- Permanent artist blacklist ("never show again" beyond cooldown)
- Rejection reasons
- Preview volume control

## Exploring

Ideas we're considering. Feedback welcome -- open an issue or discussion if any of these matter to you.

### Discovery

- Genre extraction from listening data (for non-library installs)
- Deeper listening-source data (Spotify saved albums, TIDAL favorites, Deezer flow)
- Contextual discovery-mode presets
- Additional graph-based discovery modes

### Integrations

- Prowlarr integration
- Odesli / song.link resolution
- Apple Music / iTunes metadata enrichment

### UX

- Contextual / seasonal discovery presets
- Notification digest

## Future

Good ideas with no timeline yet.

- Album-level discovery (not just artists)
- Taste DNA / shareable profile
- Audition playlists ("try before you add")
- Interactive API docs (Swagger/Scalar UI)
## Experiments

Low confidence. Would build only with real demand.

- Festival lineup scanner
- Blended household discovery / party mode
- Playback-behavior feedback loop
- Listening-history time analysis
- Human-curated subscription sources
- Beatport discovery (electronic music)
- Social / collaborative discovery
- Advanced analytics export
- Navidrome WASM plugin
- TUI client (terminal UI for discovery and approval)
- Native desktop client (Linux/Mac/Windows) -- PWA install already covers most of this
- Native mobile apps (Android/iOS) -- PWA is already installable; native value is mostly reliable push notifications
