**AI-powered music discovery for your *arr stack.** Connect your listening sources (ListenBrainz, Last.fm, Spotify, Plex, Jellyfin, Discogs), pick an AI provider, and Digarr builds a taste profile, discovers new artists through a 7-stage pipeline, and scores them with a weighted formula that learns from your feedback. Approve what you like -- artists go straight to Lidarr, Spotify playlists, or your media server. Describe a mood in plain English and get instant results. Set up subscriptions that discover new music on a schedule while you sleep. Generate weekly digest playlists automatically. Browse your library by genre with deep-cut discovery. All self-hosted, all yours.

> **Beta software -- working toward v1.0.** Usable and actively developed, but expect rough edges. Things move fast during the beta -- there may be several releases per day with bug fixes, new features, and improvements. Check the [releases page](https://github.com/iuliandita/digarr/releases) frequently and read the release notes before updating. We'd love your help: set it up, break things, [report issues](https://github.com/iuliandita/digarr/issues), and share your feature ideas.
>
> Free and open source, forever. No tracking, no telemetry, no data collection -- your music taste stays on your server.

> [!NOTE]
> **Built with AI.** Digarr is built with the help of agentic AI coding tools. A human drives the roadmap, designs the architecture, makes every feature decision, and reviews the output -- but the code and tests are largely AI-generated. All output is reviewed for security issues and generic AI slop before it ships. This is stated upfront because transparency matters. If that's a dealbreaker for you, no hard feelings.

## What Makes Digarr Different

### 7-Stage AI Pipeline
Not just "here are similar artists." Digarr collects your taste from up to 6 sources, asks an AI to reason about what you'd like and why, scores candidates with a configurable weighted formula, deduplicates across batches, and learns from your approve/reject feedback over time.

### Mood Discovery
Type "something like Boards of Canada but darker" or "upbeat 90s pop for a road trip" and get instant AI-powered results. No menus, no filters -- just plain English.

### Auto-Playlists
Generate curated playlists from your approved recommendations and push them to Navidrome, Jellyfin, Plex, or export as M3U/XSPF. Four strategies: Weekly Digest, Genre Focus, Mood Mix, and Rediscover.

### Your AI, Your Choice
Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama (local, free), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Every recommendation includes a written explanation of why the artist matches your taste.

### Lidarr Optional
Works without Lidarr in pure discovery mode. When connected, approved artists get added with your preferred quality/metadata profiles. Also supports Spotify playlist, Navidrome, Jellyfin, and Plex as approval targets.

### Cross-Platform Search
Search for artists across Spotify, Deezer, MusicBrainz, TIDAL, and Bandcamp simultaneously. Results are deduplicated and merged. One-click Quick Discover on any result.

## Quick Start

```sh
mkdir digarr && cd digarr
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iuliandita/digarr/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iuliandita/digarr/main/deploy/docker/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env -- set DB_PASS at minimum
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the setup wizard. Alternatively, fill in the service env vars in `.env` and setup completes automatically on first boot. Database migrations run automatically on every startup.

For local development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How It Works

Digarr runs a 7-stage recommendation pipeline:

1. **Collect** -- fetches your Lidarr library (or skips in discovery mode)
2. **Analyze** -- builds a taste profile from all connected sources
3. **Discover** -- queries Last.fm similar, Discogs genres, AI recommendations, and library seeds
4. **Resolve** -- validates against MusicBrainz, fetches metadata/images, genre-aware disambiguation
5. **Score** -- weighted composite formula with configurable weights
6. **Filter** -- removes library duplicates, rejected artists (with cooldown), low scores
7. **Store** -- persists batch and recommendations

Runs on a cron schedule, manually, or via subscriptions for targeted discovery.

## Requirements

| Service | Required | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Lidarr** | Optional | Music library management + auto-download |
| **Listening source** | At least one | ListenBrainz, Last.fm, Spotify, Plex, Jellyfin, or Discogs |
| **AI Provider** | Yes | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, or any compatible endpoint |
| **PostgreSQL** | Yes | Data storage (included in Docker Compose) |

---

## Configuration

All configuration is done through the web UI after initial setup -- connections, scoring weights, cron schedule, and preferences are all set there. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list of environment variable fallbacks (useful for zero-touch Docker deployments).

## Deployment

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|

## Friends

Other self-hosted music discovery projects worth checking out -- each takes a different approach:

| Project | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| [Lidify](https://github.com/TheWicklowWolf/Lidify) | The OG. Lidarr library + Last.fm similar artists. Simple, focused. |
| [Aurral](https://github.com/lklynet/aurral) | Last.fm tag similarity + Weekly Flow playlists via Soulseek/Navidrome. |
| [MixArr](https://github.com/aquantumofdonuts/mixarr) | 56 subscription types across 12 services. Widest net in the space. |
| [Curatorr](https://github.com/MickyGX/curatorr) | Behavior-first. Scores artists on skips/play completion, not tags. |
| [Brainarr](https://github.com/RicherTunes/Brainarr) | Native Lidarr plugin. Privacy-first with local AI. |
| [Sonobarr](https://github.com/Dodelidoo-Labs/sonobarr) | Last.fm discovery with optional AI assistant. Real-time UI. |
| [Explo](https://github.com/LumePart/Explo) | Discover Weekly for self-hosted. ListenBrainz recs to your media server. |
| [MusicMoveArr Datasets](https://github.com/MusicMoveArr/Datasets) | MB/Spotify/Deezer/Tidal datasets -- used by Digarr for genre enrichment. |
