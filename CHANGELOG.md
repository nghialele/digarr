# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are documented here.

## v0.23.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Artist Radio discovery mode seeded from any artist via ListenBrainz radio API
- User Radio discovery mode that generates radio from a user's top listened artist
- Similar Users (Deep) discovery mode that samples top artists from taste-matched ListenBrainz users
- Artist Radio and Similar Users subscription feed types for scheduled ListenBrainz discovery
- Renamed existing Similar Users mode to Similar Users (Quick) for clarity

## v0.22.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Deezer OAuth2 connect flow with server-side credentials (DEEZER_APP_ID / DEEZER_APP_SECRET)
- Authenticated Deezer data sources: favorites, followed artists, Flow recommendations, and playlist import
- Deezer subscription adapter with four feed types for scheduled discovery
- One-click import buttons for Deezer favorites and followed artists on the Settings page
- Integration capabilities table on the Settings Connections tab and in the README
- 19 new i18n keys across all 15 locales for Deezer UI and subscription feeds

## v0.21.1 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Locale catalogs now read naturally across the shipped languages instead of leaving large English fallback blocks in genre browsing, job history, library reconciliation, and common UI actions
- Register and voice are more consistent across translations, including Romanian formal UI copy and less literal machine-translated wording in multiple locales
- Translation copy around pull-to-refresh, queueing, playlist actions, and "you're all caught up" states now fits the app context better across languages

## v0.21.0 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Full multilingual UI support across 15 shipped locales, with visible language switchers before and after login
- Persisted per-user locale preference plus localized auth, setup, dashboard, discover, settings, analytics, subscriptions, and library surfaces
- Translation maintenance tooling and browser coverage for language switching and localized flows

### Fixed

- Manual full scans now propagate the resolved UI locale into AI discovery, so generated reasoning matches the active interface language
- Interactive discovery requests now prefer the explicit request locale over stale saved locale state, so immediate language switches do not leak old-language AI output

### Changed

- AI-assisted discovery now separates `promptLocale` from `responseLocale`, so mood and quick-discover prompts can stay language-aware while the returned reasoning follows the selected UI locale
- Translation catalogs are now explicit and complete per locale instead of silently inheriting missing keys from English

## v0.20.4 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Settings preference updates now merge partial values safely instead of dropping stored defaults or restarting schedulers on unrelated saves
- Backup restore now recreates the backed-up state cleanly by clearing included tables before re-importing data
- Similar Artist subscriptions now respect the configured result limit consistently
- Setup no longer exposes pre-auth connection-test routes, OIDC only auto-links verified emails, and private-host webhook guards now catch IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypasses

### Changed

- Playlist target matching now uses a shared scoring helper across Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby
- README, contributing guidance, Synology docs, screenshots, and roadmap text were tightened for clarity and release accuracy

## v0.20.3 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Discovery modes on the Discover page, with runnable ListenBrainz, Release Radar, and Similar Artist Web flows
- Discovery-mode subscriptions that reuse the existing subscription runner, scheduler, job history, and browser coverage

### Fixed

- Manual discovery-mode runs now return immediately with a 202 response instead of blocking on the full run
- Discovery-mode routes now reject unavailable modes explicitly instead of allowing silent no-op runs
- Discovery-mode subscriptions now persist the selected provider/fallback execution context so scheduled runs match the manual form

### Changed

- Labels and Artist Relationships remain visible in the discovery-mode catalog, but are explicitly marked unavailable until they have real executors
- Release Radar no longer exposes the unused `includeReissues` toggle
- README, API docs, and roadmap docs are aligned with the shipped discovery-mode surface

## v0.20.2 - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- Search and job API query validation now match the documented contract, including limits, offsets, and allowed job types
- Query-token auth is now limited to the documented SSE and preview-audio endpoints
- Playlist ordering now follows stored track positions consistently

### Changed

- CI now separates mocked API route contract tests from browser E2E coverage, and the browser suite runs against an isolated Playwright database
- PostgreSQL pool sizing and SSL behavior can now be configured explicitly through environment variables
- Hot recommendation, playlist, subscription, target, and session query paths now have supporting indexes, and older migrations are safer to re-run

## v0.20.1 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Emby and Jellyfin connection tests now validate the configured user library scope instead of only checking server info
- Playlist export to Emby and Jellyfin now respects TLS-skip settings, and Emby track matching prefers exact title and artist hits
- Metadata fallback HTTP requests now block redirects, reject private hosts at request time, and keep no-content delete responses typed honestly

### Changed

- Provider and admin config typing is stricter at shared boundaries
- API, README, roadmap, and issue template docs are aligned with shipped Emby support and local tooling rules

## v0.20.0 - 2026-04-09

- Improved library sync robustness for all media server types

## v0.19.2 - 2026-04-09

### Changed

## v0.19.0 - 2026-04-09

- Admin job history and health endpoints for pipeline, subscription, target, and playlist work
- API route tests, Playwright browser tests, and CI gates for critical workflows
- Application-level backup and restore with encrypted field handling

### Changed

### Added

- Data hygiene tools for genre rebuilds, rescoring, dedupe repair, AI reasoning audit, and session cleanup

### Fixed

- Security and resilience hardening across auth, backup/restore, scoring, webhooks, and deployment manifests
