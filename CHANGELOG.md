# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are documented here.

## Unreleased

## v0.31.7 - 2026-04-18

Phase 4 of the deep-audit remediation: database-layer correctness and performance. Six missing foreign-key indexes added, three check-then-write upsert races closed, N+1 loops in backup restore and hygiene batched into chunked statements, per-row JS genre aggregation pushed into SQL via `unnest`, and `DIGARR_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEXT` dual-key rotation landed with a runbook. Three migrations; no user action required beyond standard deploy.

### Fixed

- `upsertLibrarySyncState`, `upsertOverride`, and `upsertAlbumOverride` no longer race under concurrent writes. Rewritten as atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with the three natural-key unique indexes migrated to `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` so shared-cursor rows (nullable `user_id`) participate in conflict matching.
- `preferencesSchema` no longer accepts arbitrary unknown keys. `.passthrough()` replaced with `.strict()` on both the outer and `scoringWeights` objects, closing a storage-bloat surface where a hostile admin client could inflate the `preferences` jsonb indefinitely.
- Backup key-mismatch detection now flags `settings.preferences.fanartApiKey` alongside top-level sensitive columns so a restore into a different-key deployment surfaces every field that may be unreadable.
- `getGenreArtists` deep_cuts view no longer wraps `artistMetadata.nameNormalized` in `lower()`. The column is already lowercased at write time; the wrapper defeated any btree index on it.

### Performance

- Six missing foreign-key indexes added: `genres(parent_genre_id)`, `recommendation_batches(subscription_id)`, `job_runs(user_id)`, `job_runs(batch_id)`, `slskd_jobs(target_id)`, `slskd_jobs(recommendation_id)`. Postgres does not auto-index FK columns; cascades and joins previously degraded to sequential scans as row count grew.
- GIN indexes on `artists.genres[]` and `artists.tags[]` so array-membership queries like `genres @> ARRAY['indie']` can use an index instead of a sequential scan.
- `pg.Pool` defaults: `max=20` (up from the libpg default of 10), `idleTimeoutMillis=30s`, server-side `statement_timeout=30s`. Caps runaway queries at the connection level.
- Backup restore batches rows (1000 per chunk) using `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with an `excluded.*` set clause. Round-trips for a 10k-row restore drop from 10k to ~10.
- Hygiene `rebuildGenres` batches inserts (2000 per chunk). `rescoreRecommendations` replaces per-row `UPDATE` with `UPDATE ... FROM unnest(ids, scores)` chunked at 5000; two array parameters regardless of row count.
- `getTopGenresForUser` and `getGenreFeedbackHistory` push their genre tallies into SQL via `unnest` + `GROUP BY` instead of materializing every row in JS and reducing.

### Added

- `DIGARR_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEXT` environment variable enables dual-key rotation mode. `decryptField` tries primary -> NEXT -> legacy; writes always use the primary. See [docs/runbooks/encryption-key-rotation.md](docs/runbooks/encryption-key-rotation.md) for the 3-deploy procedure.
- `scripts/rotate-encryption-key.ts` re-encrypts every `enc:v1:` value (including nested jsonb paths and `targets.config`) with the current primary key. Safe to re-run; idempotent.

## v0.30.5 - 2026-04-18

Phase 3 of the deep-audit remediation: 15 correctness bugs closed across pipeline, OAuth, scheduler, backup, recommendations, and rate-limit surfaces, plus a hono CVE bump. No user action required; all fixes are internal to the running deployment.

### Fixed

- Auto-approve no longer marks a recommendation as `added_to_lidarr` when the Lidarr target's `addArtist` actually failed. The status now keys off the Lidarr result's `success` flag; a Lidarr failure surfaces as `add_failed` even when a secondary target (Emby, slskd, playlist) succeeded. Lidarr is treated as the authoritative downloader for status purposes.
- CSV import and export share a formula-injection guard (`cellSafe` / `parseCell`) that strips leading `= + - @ \t \r` characters and applies RFC 4180 quote handling. Import additionally tokenizes rows with a proper quoted-field parser instead of a naive split on commas.
- OAuth `clientSecret` is now always encrypted at rest, including during the pre-auth pending window. Only `accessToken` stays plaintext when it is a pending marker, because the LIKE-prefix state lookup requires it. Existing encrypted rows are unaffected.
- OAuth token refresh preserves `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `scopes` instead of nulling them out on every refresh. Rows previously reduced to `{accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt}` after the first refresh are now restored on the next successful refresh.
- Shutdown handling: the slskd cron, library sync cron, library health cron, and stuck-detector cron are now captured as handles and `.stop()`'d on SIGTERM/SIGINT, alongside the pipeline and playlist schedulers.
- `imageFailedAt` insert-path priority now matches the update path: artist with an `imageUrl` always clears the negative cache, regardless of the `imageFailed` flag.
- `PipelineOrchestrator._currentUserId` resets in the `finally` block so subsequent non-pipeline emits don't inherit a stale userId.
- Admin reasoning-generation prompts interpolate `artistName` through `JSON.stringify` to neutralize artist-name injection into the prompt structure.
- Recommendation status filters (`?status=foo,bar,...`) are allowlisted against `VALID_STATUSES` before hitting the DB. Unknown tokens (including SQL-looking payloads) are dropped instead of being passed to `inArray`.
- Jellyfin playlist `searchTrack` now logs transport errors with the artist and track context, instead of swallowing them silently with a `catch {}`.
- Login pays the scrypt cost for missing usernames too (a pre-computed `DUMMY_PASSWORD_HASH` is verified in the `user == null` branch), closing a timing-based user-enumeration oracle.
- Backup restore (`POST /api/admin/restore`) now requires `?confirm=true` in addition to `?force=`. The `data` object schema is strict: unknown keys are rejected, closing a prototype-pollution surface that `.passthrough()` previously left open.

### Changed

- Rate-limit middleware shares one `setInterval` prune loop across all limiter instances via a module-level registry, instead of each instance owning its own. Exposes `__shutdownRateLimiter()` for test cleanup.
- `hono` pinned >=4.12.14 (GHSA-458j-xx4x-4375, medium HTML-injection in `hono/jsx` SSR; Digarr does not use that path but the dep-scan gate required it).
- Vestigial `BatchStats.scored` field dropped from the `batches` query type; the orchestrator, webhook payload, and jobs API already used `discovered`.

## v0.29.3 - 2026-04-18

Phase 2 of the deep-audit remediation: SSRF hardening for outbound HTTP and Last.fm api-key redaction in error logs.

### Fixed

- Webhook and outbound HTTP callers now pin the resolved IP after DNS lookup to defeat DNS-rebinding TOCTOU attacks. HTTPS callers preserve SNI via a bracketed-host fallback; HTTP callers rewrite the hostname to the pinned address while setting the `Host` header back to the original value.
- `isPrivateIp` covers more reserved ranges (link-local v6, loopback variants, cloud-metadata IPs) and normalizes bracketed IPv6 hosts before evaluation. Webhook SSRF allowlists tightened accordingly.
- OIDC test endpoint and other admin-adjacent test URL helpers are now gated behind the admin role, closing a bypass where an authenticated non-admin could probe arbitrary hosts via the test path.
- Last.fm API keys (and other sensitive query params like `apikey`, `key`, `token`, `secret`, `password`) are redacted from `HttpError` messages, `redactUrlForLog` output, and blocked-redirect error paths. A URL-parser-failure fallback (`redactQueryStringFallback`) handles malformed inputs that break `new URL()`.

### Changed

- Zod schemas migrated to the `z` namespace import across all `src/server/schemas/*` modules and matching tests, settling on a single import style.

## v0.28.5 - 2026-04-17

Security-critical release: closes the three-step unauthenticated admin-takeover chain identified in the deep audit, plus surrounding auth-surface hardening. All authenticated users should keep working without action; the tightenings only affect new registrations and newly-rotated passwords.

### Fixed

- CIDR matching now supports IPv6 with a strict parser. The prior IPv4-only implementation silently passed IPv6 addresses through an integer-only check, allowing an IPv6 address like `2400:beef::1` to match an unrelated `2400:cb00::/32` CIDR and bypass proxy-auth trust boundaries. The new parser validates each family independently and rejects leading-zero octets (CVE-2021-29923 class).
- `PROXY_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXIES` entries are validated at boot. Unbounded ranges (`0.0.0.0/0`, `::/0`, plus every textual variant that normalizes to `/0`) are refused so a misconfigured deployment fails loudly instead of silently trusting the internet.
- Session tokens are no longer cached in an in-memory per-user map. Proxy-auth previously reused any active session for the resolved user, which could hand a password-mode session's raw token back via `/api/auth/status` when the same user had also signed in through the proxy. Each proxy-auth request now mints a fresh session pinned to an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie.
- `/api/auth/status` no longer echoes session tokens to the client. Authenticated callers rely on the cookie for follow-up requests; the response exposes `authenticated`, `userId`, and `isAdmin` instead.
- First-admin bootstrap is now serialized via a unique partial index on `users(is_admin) WHERE is_admin = true`. Two concurrent setup or registration requests can no longer both succeed as admin; the losing request is resolved to the existing admin or retried as a non-admin. The migration auto-demotes extra admins (keeping the oldest) with a `RAISE NOTICE` when applied against a database that previously accumulated duplicates.
- OIDC callbacks sanitize the `preferred_username` claim (allowlist `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, 50-char cap) so an untrusted IdP cannot inject arbitrary characters into usernames that flow into filesystem, SQL, or UI contexts.
- Verbose OIDC error messages no longer leak into the login-screen URL fragment. Short stable codes (`config`, `oidc_failed`) replace them; detail stays in the server log.
- Auth middleware returns `503 re-run setup` for the degenerate state where setup is flagged complete but no users exist (orphaned DB state). Callers no longer retry against a dead deployment indefinitely.

### Changed

- OIDC email-verified auto-link is now opt-in. A new `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL_VERIFIED` environment variable (default `false`) must be set to `true` before an OIDC sign-in will automatically link to an existing local account on matching `email_verified=true` claim. `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md` documents the threat model (single-tenant IdPs safe to enable, public issuers not).
- `/api/auth/status` no longer exposes `version` or `proxyAuthEnabled` to unauthenticated callers. Those fields moved to a new auth-gated `GET /api/auth/meta` endpoint. `oidcEnabled` stays public so the login screen can still render the OIDC sign-in button.
- Password minimum length is now 12 characters across registration and password changes. Existing users with shorter passwords continue to log in; the new minimum only applies when a password is set or rotated.
- Hono bumped to 4.12.14 to pick up GHSA-458j-xx4x-4375 (medium-severity HTML injection in `hono/jsx` SSR; Digarr does not use that path, but the upstream CI scan blocks without the fix).

## v0.27.12 - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Library sync no longer aborts when MusicBrainz returns a transient error (HTTP 503, timeouts, network blips). The affected artist or album is left unreconciled and retried on the next sync run. A warning with the failure count appears on the Library Sources panel so the user knows some data was skipped. Applies to all library sources (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Lidarr) since they share the same reconciler. Fixes #115.

### Changed

- The MusicBrainz client now retries transient failures (5xx, 429, network errors) up to 3 times with exponential backoff plus jitter, honoring `Retry-After` when provided. This absorbs short MB hiccups before the graceful-degrade path kicks in.

## v0.27.11 - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Self-hosted Plex, Jellyfin, Emby URLs behind reverse proxies on a LAN are no longer rejected as SSRF targets. The "URL resolves to a private/internal IP" block treated the user's own media server like an untrusted webhook destination, which broke split-horizon DNS deployments (public hostname resolving to a private IP) and every direct-LAN setup.
- Self-hosted AI base URLs are accepted for the same reason. Local Ollama at the default `http://localhost:11434` and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint on a private address now work without tripping the private-IP guard on connect or at request time.

### Changed

- The private-IP guard stays in place for user-configurable outbound URLs that can plausibly be adversarially set (webhooks, OIDC issuer, metadata fallback, fanart.tv, musicinfo.pro). It's only relaxed on admin-owned service URLs where private IPs are the expected default.

## v0.26.7 - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Legacy shared-token auth can no longer write user locale, password, or preference settings that are meant for session-authenticated users only
- Docker, Helm, raw Kubernetes, CI, and issue-template defaults were audited and brought back in line with the current release surface

### Changed

- Top-level docs and roadmap docs were tightened to reduce duplicated release detail and point readers at the changelog for per-release history
- Dev helper scripts were simplified and cleaned up for more predictable local setup and teardown behavior

## v0.26.6 - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Backup restore now resets serial sequences after replaying explicit row ids, so later inserts do not fail with duplicate-key errors
- User identity lookups now enforce unique non-null email and OIDC subject values at the database level
- Linked `slskd` workers now accept Lidarr's paginated wanted-release payloads instead of assuming a top-level array, fixing repeated sync failures against current Lidarr builds

## v0.26.5 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Large library syncs now batch `library_artists` and `library_albums` inserts instead of sending a single oversized statement that can exceed database host-parameter limits
- Library sync batching now sizes inserts against SQLite-compatible parameter ceilings so the write path stays safe across current and future database backends

## v0.26.4 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Remaining shared UI forms, dialogs, and admin surfaces now use locale catalogs instead of hardcoded English copy
- Settings and subscription server errors now resolve through the active request locale instead of leaking raw English into localized screens
- Shipped locale catalogs now pass stricter translation-quality checks, including same-as-English detection and corrected native orthography for languages that use accents or diacritics

## v0.26.3 - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Settings now exposes `Job History` and `System Health` as first-class tabs in the shared settings shell, and the dashboard no longer carries the full system-health block at the top
- Settings > Targets now mirrors the connections-style admin controls more closely, including inline editing, enabled/shared state, linked Lidarr context, and visible test results

### Fixed

- Discover > Subscriptions now uses the same content width as the other primary app pages
- Library Health now persists the latest scan snapshot, shows last-sync timing, auto-rescans on the configured library-sync interval, and keeps a manual `Sync Now` action
- Jobs health now includes library-sync status so the new system-health tab can surface it alongside pipeline, subscription, playlist, and source state
- Fresh databases now skip pre-migration auto-backups until the app tables exist, avoiding noisy startup warnings during first boot and Playwright setup

## v0.26.2 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Completing setup no longer leaves the app in an unauthenticated zero-user state; public setup routes still work, but registration or login is required once setup is finished
- Settings now preserve unset secrets instead of masking them as saved credentials, so service status no longer shows false connected states
- Settings now show Deezer and Emby service icons, and more admin-facing copy is routed through shipped locale keys

### Changed

- README multilingual docs now list all shipped languages and note that translations are machine-generated pending community fixes
- API docs, roadmap notes, and both CI pipelines were updated to match the current setup and i18n checks

## v0.26.1 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Shipped ListenBrainz radio modes no longer appear as "not shipped yet", and unavailable cards now explain why they are blocked
- Manual discovery-mode runs now return a `jobId` immediately, so the UI can track the accepted job instead of showing a blind success toast
- ListenBrainz Artist Radio now resolves artist-name seeds to MusicBrainz IDs before the run is accepted, so invalid free-text seeds fail up front instead of dying silently in the background
- Discovery-run feedback now surfaces quick job failures to the user instead of only logging them server-side
- Discovery-mode availability reasons now fall back to the original message when a locale-specific alias is missing

## v0.26.0 - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Discovery Modes now live on their own page under the Discover menu, keeping the main Discover view focused on recommendation review

## v0.25.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Settings > Targets now supports creating `slskd` download targets, including an optional linked Lidarr target for combined approvals
- Linked `slskd` targets now run a background wanted-release worker with import-verified completion, plus admin sync and active-job endpoints

### Fixed

- Combined `slskd` approvals can now target an explicit Lidarr destination instead of guessing when multiple Lidarr targets exist
- Recommendation cards now surface partial target failures when Lidarr succeeds but the follow-up `slskd` step fails

## v0.24.4 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Discovery mode cards, field labels, availability notices, and monitoring options now use the active locale across all shipped languages
- Job and system health "last run" relative times now follow the active locale instead of always showing English `ago`

## v0.24.3 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Stored API tokens are now validated against an authenticated auth endpoint instead of the public setup status route
- Recommendation approval and export routes now reject invalid `batchId` values, and approval to an unknown target now returns a clear `400` instead of a false success
- Non-admin users can no longer save private or internal Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby URLs that would later be used for server-side requests
- OIDC connection tests are now admin-only and reject private or internal issuer URLs

### Changed

- OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible providers now share the same wrapped JSON response unwrapping helper
- README, API docs, contributing notes, and screenshots were refreshed to match the current setup and integration surface

## v0.24.2 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Translate all remaining hardcoded English strings across 12 UI areas (settings admin, search reasons, mood bar, genre cards, service status, job history, album coverage, integration table, analytics sources)
- Add proper translations for all 89 new keys across all 15 supported languages

## v0.24.1 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Translate all hardcoded English strings across the main UI surfaces (navigation, dashboard, discover, settings, analytics, job history, playlists, subscriptions, setup wizard, search, genre detail, library health, user management)

## v0.24.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Tag Radio discovery mode** (`lb-tag-radio`): discover artists by genre/style tags via ListenBrainz radio. Supports multiple tags with per-tag weights, raw LB syntax, and popularity filtering.
- **Tag Radio subscription feed**: recurring tag-based artist discovery via the ListenBrainz adapter.
- **Recording-artist cache**: persistent cache for MusicBrainz recording-to-artist lookups, improving performance on repeat tag radio runs.

## v0.23.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Renamed existing Similar Users mode to Similar Users (Quick) for clarity

## v0.22.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Deezer OAuth2 connect flow with server-side credentials (DEEZER_APP_ID / DEEZER_APP_SECRET)
- Authenticated Deezer data sources: favorites, followed artists, Flow recommendations, and playlist import
- Deezer subscription adapter with four feed types for scheduled discovery
- One-click import buttons for Deezer favorites and followed artists on the Settings page
- Integration capabilities table on the Settings Connections tab and in the README
- 19 new i18n keys across all 15 locales for Deezer UI and subscription feeds

## v0.21.1 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- Locale catalogs now read naturally across the shipped languages instead of leaving large English fallback blocks in genre browsing, job history, library reconciliation, and common UI actions
- Register and voice are more consistent across translations, including Romanian formal UI copy and less literal machine-translated wording in multiple locales
- Translation copy around pull-to-refresh, queueing, playlist actions, and "you're all caught up" states now fits the app context better across languages

## v0.21.0 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Broad multilingual UI support across 15 shipped locales, with visible language switchers before and after login
- Persisted per-user locale preference plus localized auth, setup, dashboard, discover, settings, analytics, subscriptions, and library surfaces
- Translation maintenance tooling and browser coverage for language switching and localized flows

### Fixed

- Manual full scans now propagate the resolved UI locale into AI discovery, so generated reasoning matches the active interface language
- Interactive discovery requests now prefer the explicit request locale over stale saved locale state, so immediate language switches do not leak old-language AI output

### Changed

- AI-assisted discovery now separates `promptLocale` from `responseLocale`, so mood and quick-discover prompts can stay language-aware while the returned reasoning follows the selected UI locale
- Translation catalogs are now explicit and complete per locale instead of silently inheriting missing keys from English

## v0.20.4 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Settings preference updates now merge partial values safely instead of dropping stored defaults or restarting schedulers on unrelated saves
- Backup restore now recreates the backed-up state cleanly by clearing included tables before re-importing data
- Similar Artist subscriptions now respect the configured result limit consistently
- Setup no longer exposes pre-auth connection-test routes, OIDC only auto-links verified emails, and private-host webhook guards now catch IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypasses

### Changed

- Playlist target matching now uses a shared scoring helper across Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby
- README, contributing guidance, Synology docs, screenshots, and roadmap text were tightened for clarity and release accuracy

## v0.20.3 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Discovery modes on the dedicated `/discover/modes` page, with runnable ListenBrainz, Release Radar, and Similar Artist Web flows
- Discovery-mode subscriptions that reuse the existing subscription runner, scheduler, job history, and browser coverage

### Fixed

- Manual discovery-mode runs now return immediately with a 202 response instead of blocking on the full run
- Discovery-mode routes now reject unavailable modes explicitly instead of allowing silent no-op runs
- Discovery-mode subscriptions now persist the selected provider/fallback execution context so scheduled runs match the manual form

### Changed

- Labels and Artist Relationships remain visible in the discovery-mode catalog, but are explicitly marked unavailable until they have real executors
- Release Radar no longer exposes the unused `includeReissues` toggle
- README, API docs, and roadmap docs are aligned with the shipped discovery-mode surface

## v0.20.2 - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- Search and job API query validation now match the documented contract, including limits, offsets, and allowed job types
- Query-token auth is now limited to the documented SSE and preview-audio endpoints
- Playlist ordering now follows stored track positions consistently

### Changed

- CI now separates mocked API route contract tests from browser E2E coverage, and the browser suite runs against an isolated Playwright database
- PostgreSQL pool sizing and SSL behavior can now be configured explicitly through environment variables
- Hot recommendation, playlist, subscription, target, and session query paths now have supporting indexes, and older migrations are safer to re-run

## v0.20.1 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Emby and Jellyfin connection tests now validate the configured user library scope instead of only checking server info
- Playlist export to Emby and Jellyfin now respects TLS-skip settings, and Emby track matching prefers exact title and artist hits
- Metadata fallback HTTP requests now block redirects, reject private hosts at request time, and keep no-content delete responses typed honestly

### Changed

- Provider and admin config typing is stricter at shared boundaries
- API, README, roadmap, and issue template docs are aligned with shipped Emby support and local tooling rules

## v0.20.0 - 2026-04-09
